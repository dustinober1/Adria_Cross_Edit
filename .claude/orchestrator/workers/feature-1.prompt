You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Update services.html with new individual service prices (Color Analysis $200, Closet Edit $395)

## Orchestration Context
Update all pricing information in the website based on new pricing structure:

- Color Analysis: $200 (was $175)
- One-Event Styling: $250 (unchanged)
- The Closet Edit: $395 (was $350)
- Personal Shopping: $150/hour (3-hour minimum = $450+)
- Wardrobe Overhaul: $1,200 (unchanged)

Add "30 days of email support with a guaranteed 48-hour response time included with all packages" notice.

Files to update:
- services.html (main pricing page)
- index.html (schema priceRange)


## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-1.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/



Begin implementing the feature now.
