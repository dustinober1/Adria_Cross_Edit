            <h1>Adria Cross — Personal Stylist</h1>
            <p class="article-subtitle">It's not your body, it's your wardrobe.</p>
            <p class="article-subtitle" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1rem; margin-top: -1.5rem;">Helping women
                and men fall back in love with their clothes — by creating confidence through style that fits who you
                are, how you live, and where you're headed.</p>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>Home — Your First Impression</h2>
                <p>You've built a life you love — a career, a family, a routine that runs on ambition and purpose. But
                    when it comes to your closet? It doesn't reflect the person you've become.</p>
                <p>You have so many clothes, but nothing feels right. You rotate the same few outfits, debate wearing
                    the "nicer" one, and wonder what's even clean. Dressing for the day has turned into a mental drain
                    instead of something that feels inspiring.</p>
                <p><strong>That's where I come in.</strong></p>
                <p>I help you simplify, refine, and rebuild your wardrobe so that every outfit feels effortless — and
                    entirely you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d;">Rediscover your style. Save time. Feel unstoppable.</p>
                <p>I help high-performing individuals reclaim confidence through a curated, wearable wardrobe — without
                    the overwhelm, waste, or guesswork.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔ A closet that actually works for your lifestyle</li>
                    <li>✔ Outfits that make you feel confident every day</li>
                    <li>✔ A luxe, practical approach to real-world dressing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All services are available virtually or in-person. Flexible scheduling for busy professionals and
                    parents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>Is This You?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a closet full of clothes but only wear the same three "go-to" outfits.</li>
                    <li>You debate wearing your nicer pieces because you don't want to seem overdressed.</li>
                    <li>You're tired of wondering what's clean or what goes together.</li>
                    <li>You own plenty of clothes but don't know how to mix them with what you already have.</li>
                    <li>You want to look confident and polished — without spending extra time or energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; margin-top: 1.5rem;">If that sounds familiar, your wardrobe
                    isn't the problem — it just needs direction.</p>

                <h3>The Problems You're Facing</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>You feel like you're in a style rut, rotating the same few pieces.</li>
                    <li>You're unsure what actually looks good together.</li>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Adria — wife, mom to two amazing girls, CrossFit coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt.
                </p>
                <p>Fashion has always been my creative outlet. As a little girl, I would spend hours putting on fashion
                    shows, restyling my dolls, and experimenting with looks long before I knew what "styling" was.</p>
                <p>Today, that same passion fuels my mission: helping real people feel confident in what they wear — not
                    just for events or photos, but every day.</p>
                <p>I know what it's like to juggle family, work, and wellness while still wanting to look and feel your
                    best. My approach combines personal empowerment with practicality — I create wardrobes that are both
                    luxurious and livable.</p>
                <p><strong>I believe getting dressed should never feel stressful. It should feel like you.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
                <p>I work with women and men who have built successful, full lives — people who value excellence in
                    everything they do and are ready for their wardrobe to reflect that same energy.</p>
                <p>My clients are professionals, entrepreneurs, parents, and go-getters who appreciate quality but need
                    their style to be effortless. They want a wardrobe that moves with their life — one that looks
                    polished without feeling overdone.</p>
                <p>Whether you're refreshing your look, redefining your image, or simply ready to feel like your best
                    self again — I'm here to make that happen.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>My Promise</h2>
                <p>I'll help you find your personal style and make your wardrobe work harder for you — without starting
                    from scratch.</p>
                <p>My services feel luxurious but are rooted in practicality, confidence, and transformation.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #c19a5d; font-size: 1.1rem;">Because the truth is simple: <em>It's
                        not your body, it's your wardrobe.</em></p>
            </div>

                <p>Yes — every service can be completed virtually for your convenience.</p>

                <h3>How do I prepare for a Closet Edit?</h3>
                <p>Set aside a couple of hours, wear something comfortable, and be open to letting go of what no longer
                    serves you. I'll handle the rest.</p>

                <h3>What areas do you serve?</h3>
